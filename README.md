Hi, Abhishek this side. I made this project applying my current knowledge of web development. 
I used HTML, CSS & Bootstrap to made the frontend of this website.
I am still learning web development and as soon as i learn new things i will keep updating this project adding new features and functionalities.
I will learn JavaScript in the upcoming days which will help me to add functionality to my projects.
